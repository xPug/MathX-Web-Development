# Project Description: MathX

Overview:
MathX is an interactive daily mathematics problem-solving game designed to engage users of all skill levels, from K-12 students to college and graduate-level learners, as well as those interested in coding practice. Inspired by the popular Wordle game, MathX presents a new math challenge every day, requiring players to solve problems across various topics and difficulty levels.

**Key Features:**

- Daily Mathematics Problem: A new problem is generated daily, covering arithmetic, algebra, geometry, calculus, probability, and coding-related math problems.

- Multiple Difficulty Levels: Players can choose from different levels based on their expertise:

    - K-12 (Elementary, Middle, and High School Math)

    - College-level Mathematics

    - Graduate-level Mathematics

    - Coding Practice (Algorithmic and Logical Thinking Problems)

- Timed Challenges: Users can attempt to solve the problem within a given time limit for added challenge.

- Streak and Leaderboard System: Tracks consecutive correct answers and ranks players based on performance.

- Hints and Explanations: Offers step-by-step hints and solutions to help players learn and improve.

**Target Audience:**

- Students looking to practice and improve their math skills.

- Educators who want to provide engaging problem-solving exercises for their students.

- Math enthusiasts seeking a daily intellectual challenge.

- Programmers and coding learners who want to sharpen their algorithmic thinking.

**Future Enhancements:**

- Personalized problem recommendations based on past performance.

- Multiplayer mode for competitive play.

- AI-generated adaptive difficulty adjustments.

- Integration with educational platforms for structured learning.

__MathX aims to make math learning fun, engaging, and rewarding for learners at all levels!__ ‚úñÔ∏è‚ûï‚ûñ‚ûóüü∞‚ôæÔ∏è
